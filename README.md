## üì∏ Sample Images

This is an example of what the site would look like if used for a hackathon. In this case, this was for a hackathon called [Illuminate](https://github.com/code-the-stars/illuminate) since this website was originally designed for their hackathon.

You can see a preview of this website [***<u>here</u>***](https://zachltech.github.io/hackathon-site-revamp/)
